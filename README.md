AIon Technology — Spatial Grid Referencing Protocol (SGR)
A new standard for precise, controllable AI image editing.
Overview
Modern AI image models are powerful, but they all share the same critical flaw:
they cannot edit specific regions with precision.

Users regenerate entire images, waste compute, lose time, and fight with unpredictable outputs.
Companies build complex UIs, masks, and pipelines to compensate — but the core problem remains.

AIon Technology introduces the Spatial Grid Referencing Protocol (SGR):
a universal, model‑agnostic method that allows humans and AI systems to communicate exact spatial intent inside any image.

SGR is not a model.
SGR is not a plugin.
SGR is infrastructure — a protocol that sits above any AI provider and makes image editing predictable, fast, and controllable.

What SGR Solves
1. Precise regional control
Users can specify exact areas of an image using a universal grid system.

2. Zero guesswork
The AI no longer “interprets” vague instructions.
It receives explicit spatial coordinates.

3. Model‑agnostic integration
Works with OpenAI, Google, xAI, Midjourney, Runway, Adobe, Meta, Kling, Luma, and any future provider.

4. Massive reduction in compute waste
No more full‑image regenerations.
Only the targeted region is modified.

5. Predictable UX
Every change is consistent, repeatable, and controllable.

How It Works
SGR overlays a universal grid on any image.
The user (or UI) specifies:

the region

the modification

the constraints

the expected output

The protocol converts this into a structured instruction that any AI model can understand.

This creates a shared spatial language between humans and AI.

Roadmap
Phase 1 — Public Release
Publish SGR specification

Release reference implementation

Provide example integrations

Phase 2 — Multi‑Provider Connectors
OpenAI

Google

xAI

Midjourney

Runway

Adobe

Meta

Kling

Luma

Phase 3 — Video & Animation Protocol
Extending SGR to temporal grids for frame‑accurate editing.

Phase 4 — Full Multimodal Protocol
Unified spatial + temporal + audio referencing.

Licensing (Early Access Model)
Early Access License (limited to 1 company): USD 250,000  
This tier grants early access to the protocol before the general licensing program opens.
It is intended for a single partner who wants to integrate, test, and influence the evolution of the system ahead of the industry.

Standard Non‑Exclusive License: USD 2,500,000  
After the Early Access phase, the protocol will be available under a standard non‑exclusive corporate license.
This tier provides full commercial usage rights, integration support, and long‑term compatibility updates.

Companies interested in licensing or evaluation access may contact us for details.

About AIon Technology
AIon Technology is a systems‑first company focused on building the universal interaction layer for multimodal AI.
We do not compete with models — we design the protocols that make them usable, controllable, and predictable.

Our work is based on three principles:

1. Modularity over complexity
Every component we build is designed as a standalone module that can integrate into any ecosystem.
This ensures long‑term compatibility, low friction, and rapid adoption.

2. Precision as a foundation, not a feature
AI systems today rely heavily on interpretation.
AIon Technology replaces ambiguity with structure, enabling deterministic behavior across models, providers, and modalities.

3. Infrastructure, not tools
We create standards, not utilities.
Our protocols are designed to operate above any AI model — present or future — giving companies a stable layer of control independent of model architecture or vendor.

AIon Technology’s mission is to define the next generation of human–AI interaction:
a world where creativity, editing, and multimodal workflows are guided by clear, universal protocols instead of guesswork.

The Spatial Grid Referencing Protocol (SGR) is the first step in this direction.
It establishes a shared spatial language for AI image editing, enabling precise regional control across all major AI providers.

We are committed to expanding this foundation into video, audio, and full multimodal orchestration — building the standards that the next decade of AI will rely on.
