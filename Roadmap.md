AIon Technology — Multimodal Interaction Protocols Roadmap (2026)
Overview
AIon Technology is building the first universal multimodal interaction standard for AI systems.
This standard enables precise, low‑compute, real‑time iteration across image, audio, and video without retraining models, modifying neural networks, or relying on heavy hardware.

Core protocols:

RT‑IVFS + SGR — Real‑Time Iterative Visual Feedback System + Spatial Grid Referencing

RT‑IAFS — Real‑Time Iterative Audio Feedback System

RT‑IVS — Real‑Time Iterative Video System (derived from the two previous protocols)

AIon Technology does not compete in models.

Phase 1 — Image (RT‑IVFS + SGR) — IN DEVELOPMENT
Goal
Create a precise, region‑based visual editing system using Spatial Grid Referencing (SGR).

Why Phase 1?
Easiest to build

Easiest to test

Immediate visual impact

Foundation for video

Zero dependencies

Enables mouse → grid → AI precision

Key Innovation: Spatial Grid Referencing (SGR)
A coordinate‑based grid overlay (visible or invisible) that allows exact region selection.

Examples:

“Darken the background in C4.”

“Remove the object in G7.”

“Enhance the eyes in B2.”

Components
Grid generation

Mouse → cell detection

Natural‑language corrections + coordinates

Parameter‑based refinement

Non‑destructive iteration

JSON region mapping

Next Steps
Publish grid module

Document SGR specification

Create demo image

Integrate pointer‑hook module

Phase 2 — Audio (RT‑IAFS) — COMPLETED
Goal
Enable rapid, precise iteration in AI‑assisted music creation without regenerating full tracks.

Achievements
Short previews

Natural‑language corrections

Parameter‑based refinement

No full regeneration

Works with lightweight models

Licensing value: 250,000 USD

Next Steps
Publish protocol documentation

Integrate with PublicadorBot

Release public demo

Phase 3 — Video (RT‑IVS) — PLANNED
Goal
Real‑time iterative control over video without regenerating full clips.

How It Works
Video = image + audio + time  
By chaining the two existing protocols:

RT‑IVFS + SGR → spatial iteration

RT‑IAFS → temporal iteration

RT‑IVS = spatiotemporal iteration

Components
Timeline segmentation

Spatial grid per frame

Short video previews

Natural‑language corrections

Region‑based editing

Phase 4 — Commercial Integration
Goal
Convert protocols into licensable products.

Actions
Publish GitHub repository

Launch announcement on X

Prepare enterprise pitch

Create landing page

Document use cases

Phase 5 — AIon Ecosystem (2026–2027)
Planned Expansions
Real‑Time Design Feedback

Real‑Time Animation Feedback

Real‑Time Simulation Feedback

Lightweight hardware integration

Developer SDK
