AIon Technology — Multimodal Interaction Protocols Roadmap (2026)
Overview
AIon Technology develops next‑generation human–AI interaction protocols that enable fast iteration, high precision, and extremely low compute cost — without retraining models, without modifying neural networks, and without relying on large hardware clusters.

This roadmap unifies three core systems:

RT‑IAFS — Real‑Time Iterative Audio Feedback System

RT‑IVFS + SGR — Real‑Time Iterative Visual Feedback System + Spatial Grid Referencing

RT‑IVS — Real‑Time Iterative Video System (derived from the two previous protocols)

Together, they form the foundation of a universal multimodal interaction standard.

Phase 1 — Audio (RT‑IAFS) — COMPLETED
Status: ✔ Completed
Goal: Enable rapid iteration in AI‑assisted music creation without regenerating full tracks.
Achievements
Short audio previews (“time‑lapses”)

Natural‑language corrections

Parameter‑based refinement

No full regeneration required

Works with lightweight models (e.g., Phi‑3 Mini)

Licensing proposal: 250,000 USD

Next Steps
Publish full protocol documentation

Integrate with PublicadorBot

Release public demo (preview + iteration)

Phase 2 — Image (RT‑IVFS + SGR) — IN DEVELOPMENT
Status: 🚀 Active
Goal: Achieve precise visual iteration without regenerating entire images.
Key Innovation: Spatial Grid Referencing (SGR)
A coordinate‑based grid overlay that allows the user to specify exact regions for modification.

Examples:

“Darken the background in C4.”

“Remove the object in G7.”

“Improve the expression in B2–C3.”

Components
Fast visual previews

Grid overlay understandable by both human and AI

Natural‑language corrections + coordinates

Parameter‑based regional refinement

Iteration without destroying correct elements

Next Steps
Define standard visual parameters

Publish grid specification

Add protocol documentation to GitHub

Prepare conceptual demo

Phase 3 — Video (RT‑IVS) — PLANNED
Status: 🧩 Derived from previous phases
Goal: Real‑time iterative control over video without regenerating full clips.
How It Works
Video = audio + image + time  
By chaining the two existing protocols:

RT‑IAFS → temporal iteration

RT‑IVFS + SGR → spatial iteration

RT‑IVS = spatiotemporal iteration

Components
Timeline segmentation

Spatial grid per frame

Short video previews (clips)

Natural‑language corrections:

“At second 3, cell D6, remove the object.”

“Between 5–7s, increase brightness in the upper area.”

Next Steps
Define timeline grid

Specify video parameters

Integrate audio + image + time

Draft technical documentation

Phase 4 — Commercial Integration
Goal: Convert protocols into licensable products.
Actions
Publish official GitHub repository

Launch announcement on X

Prepare pitch for Microsoft and other big tech companies

Create a simple landing page

Document use cases and industry applications

Phase 5 — AIon Ecosystem (2026–2027)
Planned Expansions
Real‑Time Design Feedback

Real‑Time Animation Feedback

Real‑Time Simulation Feedback

Lightweight hardware integration

Developer SDK for external adoption

Philosophy
AIon Technology does not compete in models.
AIon Technology competes in protocols.
