Visual Continuity Experiments
This repository contains a set of exploratory tests focused on frame‑to‑frame stability in visual processes.
The goal is to study how to maintain coherence in:

composition

proportions

style

persistent elements

while applying controlled variations within a defined space.

These experiments are part of a broader investigation into visual stability methods, relevant for animation, design, simulation, and other creative workflows where continuity matters.

Current tests explore:

working inside a fixed frame

evaluating changes between consecutive states

measuring visual consistency

documenting reproducible results

This document will expand as new experiments are conducted.
