RT‑IAFS‑001 — Activation and Validation of the Audio Timeline (Successful Test)
1. Overview
This test validates the activation of the RT‑IAFS module in its minimal functional form:
a 10‑second linear audio timeline capable of stable playback and precise, localized modification without affecting the rest of the signal.

The goal was to confirm that the system could:

generate a base audio sequence

reproduce it reliably

identify exact temporal nodes

modify only the selected range (1–4 seconds)

preserve continuity before and after the modified segment

The test was successful.

2. Technical Context
RT‑IAFS is the temporal counterpart of the AIFS spatial protocol.

Protocol	Dimension	Selection Unit	Effect
AIFS	Space (X,Y)	Region	Localized pixel modification
RT‑IAFS	Time (t)	Segment	Localized audio modification
Both systems share the same core principle:

Modify only the selected node while preserving the rest of the structure.

This test confirms that the temporal behavior mirrors the spatial one.

3. Engine
The test used WebAudio executed from a local HTML file inside Visual Studio.

The engine demonstrated:

stable playback

millisecond‑level timing accuracy

correct handling of node‑based modifications

no interruptions or context failures

4. Base Signal
The original tone sequence consisted of:

10 seconds total duration

notes every 0.5 seconds

safe frequency range (C4–A4)

simple structure for validation

The base signal played successfully.

5. Modification of Seconds 1–4
Only the first 4 seconds of the timeline were modified.
The original notes were replaced with a new, clearly distinguishable pattern:

Código
0.0s → C4  
0.5s → E4  
1.0s → G4  
1.5s → C5  
2.0s → E4  
2.5s → G4  
3.0s → C5  
3.5s → E4  
All other segments remained unchanged.

6. Result
✔️ Base tone played correctly
✔️ Modified segment (1–4 s) played with the new pattern
✔️ No impact on segments outside the modified range
✔️ WebAudio responded with stable timing
✔️ Timeline continuity was preserved
✔️ Behavior matched the expected AIFS‑style node modification

Conclusion:  
RT‑IAFS is validated as a functional module in its minimal implementation.

7. Significance for AIon Technology
This test confirms that:

the audio timeline is now a navigable temporal space

seconds behave as temporal nodes

localized modification does not disrupt global continuity

RT‑IAFS can scale to more complex operations

the conceptual symmetry with AIFS is exact

This marks an official milestone in the development of the AIon protocol.
